# sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing


A high-performance image (file) browser ðŸ˜‹.It is suitable for use in all places, and has been optimized for cloud computing, You can use thumbnails to quickly preview, so fast that you almost don't feel the loading time.

If you have any questions or suggestions about this project, please submit an issue on GitHub (Both Chinese and English are acceptable), or check the FAQ section at the bottom first.

## Key Features
- Multi-tab and multi-pane like Chrome and VS Code. Create tabs and preview multiple folders, move files between panes.
- Supports using 'walk' mode to browse images, automatically loading the next folder `(similar to os.walk)`, allowing you to browse all images without paging. Tested to work properly with over 27,000 files.
- It supports searching images using prompt, model, lora, etc. The used tags will be listed. Supports auto completion and translation of tags. Moreover, image search can be completed instantly.
- View image generation information, send images to other tabs, optional thumbnail preview, full-screen preview, and move.
- Preview based on the file tree structure, supports basic file operations as well as multi-select deletion/moving.


It is strongly recommended to use "Open in new tab" (in the upper right corner of the plugin startup page), which is much more comfortable than being embedded in Gradio. However, the "send image to other tab" function cannot be used in this mode.

## Image Search

During the first use, you need to click and wait for the index generation. For my case with 20,000 images, it took about 15 seconds (with an AMD 5600X CPU and PCIe SSD). For subsequent uses, it will check whether there are changes in the folder, and if so, it needs to regenerate the index. Usually, this process is very fast.

Image search supports translation, and you need to place a "tags-translate.csv" file in the plugin folder. You can find this file in the issue . Feel free to share files for other languages to facilitate everyone's use.

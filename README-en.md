# sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing


A high-performance image (file) browser ðŸ˜‹ with built-in Baidu Cloud file transfer.

It is suitable for use in all places, and has been optimized for cloud computing. You can use thumbnails to quickly preview and use the built-in Baidu Cloud to transfer files.

There is also a standalone version [baiduyun-web-transfer](https://github.com/zanllp/baiduyun-web-transfer) that does not depend on sd-webui.

If you have any questions or suggestions about this project, please submit an issue on GitHub.

## Key Features

- Multi-tab and multi-pane like Chrome and VS Code. Create tabs and preview multiple folders, move files between panes.
- Supports walk mode to browse images without pagination. Tested to work normally with 12000+ files.
- View image generation information, send images to other tabs, optional thumbnail preview, full-screen preview, and move.
- Preview based on file tree structure, with enough optimization to avoid pagination even with multiple files.
- Supports file transfer with Baidu Cloud, with dependencies downloaded only when necessary. Use drag and drop to upload and download files, and support Shift and Ctrl for multiple selection. Supports multiple tasks simultaneously.

Documentation will be updated later.

It is strongly recommended to use "Open in new tab" (in the upper right corner of the plugin startup page), which is much more comfortable than being embedded in Gradio. However, the "send image to other tab" function cannot be used in this mode.
